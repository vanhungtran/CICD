# GitLab CI/CD Tutorial - Interactive Design

## Core Interactive Components

### 1. Interactive Pipeline Builder (Main Feature)
**Location**: Index page center area
**Functionality**: 
- Visual drag-and-drop pipeline stage builder
- Users can add stages (build, test, deploy, security, etc.)
- Each stage can have multiple jobs with configurable scripts
- Real-time YAML generation in a side panel
- Preview mode shows pipeline flow with animated connections
- Templates for common scenarios (Node.js, Python, Docker, etc.)
- Save/load custom pipeline configurations

**User Flow**:
1. Select project type template or start blank
2. Add stages by clicking stage buttons
3. Configure each job with scripts, variables, rules
4. See live YAML preview updating
5. Test pipeline with simulated execution
6. Export final configuration

### 2. YAML Configuration Validator
**Location**: Tutorial page
**Functionality**:
- Live YAML syntax checking with error highlighting
- GitLab CI/CD keyword autocomplete
- Best practice suggestions
- Common mistake detection
- Configuration complexity analysis

**User Flow**:
1. Paste or type YAML configuration
2. Real-time validation feedback
3. Error explanations with fix suggestions
4. Complexity metrics and optimization tips

### 3. Pipeline Execution Simulator
**Location**: Examples page
**Functionality**:
- Step-through pipeline execution visualization
- Shows job dependencies and execution order
- Simulates different scenarios (success, failure, retry)
- Time estimation for each stage
- Resource usage visualization

**User Flow**:
1. Select example pipeline
2. Choose execution scenario
3. Watch animated step-by-step execution
4. See timing and resource metrics
5. Understand failure scenarios and recovery

### 4. Interactive Command Reference
**Location**: All pages (sidebar)
**Functionality**:
- Searchable GitLab CI/CD keyword database
- Interactive examples for each command
- Copy-to-clipboard functionality
- Related command suggestions
- Usage statistics and popularity

**User Flow**:
1. Search or browse commands
2. Click for detailed documentation
3. See live examples
4. Copy code snippets
5. Explore related concepts

## Multi-Turn Interaction Loops

### Pipeline Builder Loop
1. **Template Selection** → User chooses starting point
2. **Stage Configuration** → User customizes each stage
3. **Job Definition** → User adds scripts and rules
4. **Validation** → System checks configuration
5. **Testing** → User runs simulation
6. **Iteration** → User refines based on results
7. **Export** → User saves final configuration

### Learning Progress Loop
1. **Concept Introduction** → System explains concept
2. **Interactive Example** → User tries hands-on example
3. **Challenge** → System presents problem to solve
4. **Solution** → User implements solution
5. **Validation** → System checks correctness
6. **Next Level** → System unlocks advanced concepts
